                In situations where a shipment is not delivered, or if the corals arrive partially or entirely deceased upon delivery, Thunder Corals may opt to provide a refund. However, in most instances, a store credit will be offered instead.
                This policy is implemented to assist Thunder Corals in mitigating losses incurred due to factors beyond their control, such as carrier delays or unforeseen acts of nature.
